Hand-written CakeML filters, along with input files. Although the
filters are hand-written, they have been made highly schematic, so
that a new uxas filter can be built by copy-pasting and changing a few
lines.

The following files are test inputs (just one input in a file) which get read in when
the corresponding filter is executed.

   ARQTE  -- automation request
   ARSPE  -- automation response
   ORE    -- operating region
   LSTE   -- linesearch task
   AVSE   -- airvehicle state   (no filter supplied)

Basis FFI.

We include a standard CakeML basis_ffi.c file, to which has been
appended some code (ffifloat2double) for mapping 32-bit big-endian
floats to 64-bit little-endian doubles. This ought to be part of a
more general approach, e.g. as supported by SML structures
implementing the PACK_REAL signature.
