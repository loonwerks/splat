1. Records are declared by having ".Impl" as part of their name. But not arrays or enums.

2. Base type in array declaration is just a string, not qualified, or
   identified as a type. There is a designation there that it is a
   Data_Model::Base_type, which also seems overly constrained, since
   we want to put user-declared types there. Similarly, dimension is
   just given as a string. Presumably Data_Model::Dimension provides a
   clue as to the desired type (which should be uint).


3. Record extension syntax not appearing in json translation?

   AADL:

     data RF_Msg extends CASE_Model_Transformations::CASE_RF_Msg
     end RF_Msg;
	
     data implementation RF_Msg.Impl extends CASE_Model_Transformations::CASE_RF_Msg.Impl
     subcomponents
	payload: refined to data Command.Impl;
     end RF_Msg.Impl;

   JSON:

    AList
     [("name", String "RF_Msg"), ("kind", String "ComponentType"),
      ("category", String "data")],
    AList
     [("name", String "RF_Msg.Impl"),
      ("kind", String "ComponentImplementation"),
      ("category", String "data"),
      ("subcomponents",
       List
        [AList
          [("name", String "payload"), 
           ("kind", String "Subcomponent"),
           ("category", String "data"),
           ("classifier", String "SW::Command.Impl")]])],
