This directory provides a syntax and semantics of a core version of
the AGREE logic. It also provides a latex document. To build everything:

   $ Holmake

For tweaking the build, consult the Holmakefile in this directory.

Logical Theory
---------------

The logical development is held in agreeScript.sml. To build the
theory you need to have a recent version of HOL

   https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL

Once HOL is installed and built then the "agree" theory can be built with

  $ <HOLDIR>/bin/Holmake agreeTheory

This generates (among other by-products) the files

  agreeTheory.{sig,sml}

Later HOL theory constructions can use the "agree" theory by loading
and opening agreeTheory. Most of this is automated by the use of
Holmake.


Latex Document
---------------

The Latex document is in a "sugared" version, held in file

  agree.htex

The sugared version has various extra calls that know how to display
HOL elements (types, terms, theorems). To process it (and re-process
it) one invokes Holmake. Further documentation on how the to mark up
the sugared version to get various pleasing Latex output be found
Section 8.6 of the HOL Description document, which can be found under

   HOLDIR/Manual

of the HOL distribution, or on the web at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-14/kananaskis-14-description.pdf

Clean Up
---------

The build generates some clutter which can be removed by

   Holmake clean

or

  Holmake cleanAll

This will remove the .pdf file.

Note.
======

 More recent work can be found in

   intboolScript.sml

which adds a type of booleans and introduces definitions about the
wellformedness of a component. A small suite of examples has been
broken out to

   examplesScript.sml
