This directory provides a syntax and semantics of a core version of
the AGREE logic. It also provides a latex document.

Logical Theory
---------------

The logical development is held in agreeScript.sml. To build the
theory you need to have a recent version of HOL

   https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL

One that is installed and built then the "agree" theory can be built with

  <HOLDIR>/bin/Holmake

This generates (among other by-products) the files

  agreeTheory.{sig,sml}

Later HOL theory constructions can use the "agree" theory by loading
and opening agreeTheory. Most of this is automated by the use of
Holmake.



Latex Document
---------------

The Latex document is in a "sugared" version of the document, held in file

  agree.htex

To process it, one would run the following Unix command

  (./munge.exe < agree.htex > agree.tex; pdflatex agree)

This requires a executable

   munge.exe

to be in the "agree" directory. This "munger" does some preprocessing
to create a standard Latex file. To build munge.exe:

  a. The "agree" theory has to have been built
  b. The munge.exe has to have been built, via

        <HOLDIR>/bin/mkmunge.exe agreeTheory
