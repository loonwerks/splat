This directory provides a syntax and semantics of a core version of
the AGREE logic. It also provides a latex document.

Logical Theory
---------------

The logical development is held in agreeScript.sml. To build the
theory you need to have a recent version of HOL

   https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL

Once HOL is installed and built then the "agree" theory can be built with

  $ <HOLDIR>/bin/Holmake

This generates (among other by-products) the files

  agreeTheory.{sig,sml}

Later HOL theory constructions can use the "agree" theory by loading
and opening agreeTheory. Most of this is automated by the use of
Holmake.



Latex Document
---------------

The Latex document is in a "sugared" version, held in file

  agree.htex

The sugared version has various extra calls that know how to display
HOL elements (types, terms, theorems). To process it, one would run
the following Unix command

  (./munge.exe < agree.htex > agree.tex; pdflatex agree)

This requires an executable

   munge.exe

to be in the "agree" directory. This munger does preprocessing in order to
create a standard Latex file. To build munge.exe:

  a. The "agree" theory has to have been built
  b. Invoke mkmunge.exe on the theories being mentioned in the document:

        <HOLDIR>/bin/mkmunge.exe agreeTheory

Further documentation on how the munger output can be configured can
be found Section 8.6 of the HOL Description document, which can be found under

   HOLDIR/Manual

of the HOL distribution, or on the web at
