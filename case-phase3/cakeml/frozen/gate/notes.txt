 So there is some contortion arising from the fact that the SHM
inputs are coming from a little-endian machine in the actual test
system. Accordingly, integer elements in the SHM_Request need to
be parsed in LE order.

 However, I suspect that the generated test data, for both the
whitelist and SHM queue came from a BE system. I think this means
that, on Unix, to test with the currently generated dataset means
treating numbers in the SHM queue elements as being
big-endian (on input and output). In contrast, on the test rig,
SHM elements will be LE while whitelist elements remain BE. There
is a flag

  Utils.shm_is_LE : bool ref

that controls the direction in which parsing and printing numbers
in SHM elements.

This flag is set to False in gate.cml, while it is True in
gate.hamr.cml. I hope this is an accurate picture of what is
going on, and produces the right results in both component and
system testing.
