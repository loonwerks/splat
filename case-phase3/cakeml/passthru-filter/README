Code here builds CakeML version of the pass-through filter specified in VPM.
There is a Linux version, with mocked-up IO, in mock.cml. Build and run with

   $ make mock.cake
   $ ./mock.cake

There is a HAMR version, in hamr.cml. The only significant difference
with the mocked-up version is in the API structure, which invokes FFI
calls provided by the HAMR build.
