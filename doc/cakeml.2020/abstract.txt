Abstract.
---------

System architecture models in a language such as AADL provide a
high-level setting in which existing implementations, new design
features, high-level requirements, implementations, and verifications
can be combined. In the DARPA CASE project we have recently been
developing selected architecture-to-architecture transformations as a
way to enhance the security of a system. The transformations are
formally specified at a high level and mapped to implementations by a
sequence of deductively justified compilation steps. We will present
details of two transformations: one that creates efficient network
message filters from formal language specifications, and one that
creates runtime monitors from temporal logic specifications. For both
transformations, we illustrate an end-to-end verification path that
formally connects top-level component specifications with the binary
behavior of the newly introduced security-enforcing components. Since
these gadgets are expected to run in an embedded system, further
properties, such as liveness, are required, and we will discuss how
our framework can supply these as well. We will also discuss aspects
of how this formal toolchain is incorporated into a build system which
maps AADL architecture models to system images in seL4 and Linux.
