SPLAT overview.
===============

SPLAT is a plugin to the Collins "Architecture-Level Designer
Workbench". At present SPLAT provides support for adding filters
between existing AADL components in order to prevent reception of
badly formed or malicious messages

Input: 
------

The input to SPLAT is an AADL architecture annotated with filter specifications

Output:
------

 The output of SPLAT is a logical theory containing the
following elements for each filter specified in the architecture:

  . declaration of the record and enumeration type(s) corresponding to 
    the filter input
  . definition(s) of the wellformedness of the filter input
  . a table-driven DFA that renders a pass-fail verdict on messages,
    allowing only wellformed messages to pass
  . an encoder and a decoder from records to message formats
  . theorems showing the correctness of the DFA.

Picture.
--------

Records.
--------

  . signed/unsigned numbers of any size
  . constants
  . elements of enumerated types
  . arrays
  . characters
  . sub-records

Wellformedness.
---------------

 . numeric fields can be given interval constraints
 . enumeration fields can be restricted to only a subset of the enumeration

Pragmatics.
------------

Wellformedness is a high level predicate, it applies at the level of record datatypes.
The following considerations are needed to truly pin down the actual message format:

 . Byte order
 . Order of layout of fields
 . skipped fields
 . Padding
 . markers, magic numbers, etc
 . Packing
