\begin{abstract}
We introduce \emph{Contiguity Types}, a formalism for network message
formats. Contiguity types provide an intermediate layer between
programming language data structures and messages, offering a helpful
setting from which to automatically generate decoders, filters, and
message generators (fuzzers). L-values and R-values provide valuable
support in handling common self-describing message formats.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Network messages are used to convey information over a network. As a
result, there have been innumerable libraries and tools created that
use high level specifications as a basis for automating the creation,
validation, and decoding of such messages. Usually, these high level
specifications describe the format of a message in terms of how the
elements (fields) of the message are packed side-by-side to make the
full message. When the size of each field is known in advance, there
are really no conceptual difficulties. However, messages can be more
complicated than that.

The main source of difficulty is \emph{self-describing} messages:
those where information embedded in fields of the message determines
the structure of the message. Two of the main culprits are
variable-length arrays and unions. A \emph{variable-length array} is a
field where the number of elements in the field depends on the value
of some already-seen field (or, more generally, as the result of a
computation involving previously-seen information in the message).
The length is therefore a value determined at runtime. A \emph{union}
is deployed when some information held in a message is used to
determine the structure of later portions of the message. For example,
this can be used to support versioning where version $i$ has $n$
fields, and version $i+1$ has $n+1$. In cases where both versions need
to be supported, it can make sense to encode the version handling
inside the message, and unions are how this can be specified.

We think that tools and techniques from formal language theory such as
regular expressions, automata, grammars, parser generators, \etc\, are
an effective way to tackle message formats, and have been using the
acronym \konst{SPLAT} (Semantic Properties for Language and Automata
Theory) to refer to this approach. For example, we have used regular
expressions as a specification language for simple message formats,
with arithmetic constraints on the values allowed in
fields. Generation of the corresponding DFA results in an efficient
table-driven automaton implementing the specified constraints \cite{},
with a solid proof certificate connecting the original constraints
with the DFA behavior.

However, as mentioned above, many message formats remain outside the
realm of common formal language techniques.  Note that variable-length
fields can't be directly handled by regular or context-free means; it
seems that context-sensitive grammars can, in principle, specify such
information, but there are few tools supporting context sensitive
languages. Another possibility would be to use \emph{parser
  combinators} in order to quickly stitch together a parser; it seems
likely that parsing combinators can be instrumented to gather and
propagate contextual information. However, we are seeking a higher
level of formal specification and automation, while still being rooted
in formal languages, with their emphasis on sets of strings as the
basic notion.

\section {Contiguity Types}

The characteristic property of a message is \emph{contiguity}: all the
elements of the message are laid out side-by-side. Our assumption is
that a message is the \emph{result} of a map from structured data and
rely on a basic collection of programming language types to capture
that structure. We start with common base types (booleans, characters,
signed and unsigned integers, \etc) and form compound structures with
records, arrays, and unions.

\begin{figure}
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
 \mathit{base} & = & \konst{bool} \mid \konst{char} \mid \konst{u8} \mid
 \konst{u16} \mid \konst{u32} \mid \konst{u64}  \mid \konst{i16} \mid
 \konst{i32} \mid \konst{i64} \mid \cdots \\
 \tau & = & \mathit{base} \\
      & \mid & \konst{Recd}\; (f_1 : \tau_1) \ldots (f_n : \tau_n) \\
      & \mid & \konst{Array}\; \tau \; \mathit{exp} \\
      & \mid & \konst{Union}\; (\mathit{bexp}_1 : \tau_1) \ldots (\mathit{bexp}_n : \tau_n)
\end{array}
\]
\label{contig-types}
\caption{Contiguity types}
\end{figure}

(We will use the terms ``\emph{contiguity type}, \emph{c-type}, and $\tau$
interchangeably.) Notice that $\tau$ is defined in terms of a type of
arithmetic expressions $\mathit{exp}$ and also $\mathit{bexp}$,
boolean expressions built from $\mathit{exp}$. Now consider

\[
 \konst{Array} \; \tau \; \mathit{exp}
\]

\noindent For this to specify a varying length array dependent on
other fields of the message, its dimension $\mathit{exp}$ should be
able to refer to the \emph{values} of those fields. The challenge is
just how to express the concept of ``other fields'', \ie, we need a
notation to describe the \emph{location} in the message buffer where
the value of a field can be accessed. Our core insight is that this is
similar to the problem that programming language designers had in the
60s and 70s, resolved by the notions of \emph{L-value} and
\emph{R-value}. The idea is originally due to Christopher Strachey in
CPL and developed subsequently, for example by Dennis Ritchie in
C.\footnote{https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html}

\noindent Before getting into formal details, we discuss a few examples.

\subsection{Examples}

We will use familiar notation: records are lists of $\mathit{name} :
\tau$ elements enclosed by braces while an array field
$\konst{Array}\;c\;\mathit{dim}$ is written $c [\mathit{dim}]$. Our
current toolset for c-types supports the syntax on output but we have
yet to implement a parser.

\begin{enumerate}

\item A straightforward record where each field is of a statically known size.

\begin{verbatim}
  {A : u8
   B : {name : char [13]
        cell : i32}
   C : bool
  }
\end{verbatim}

The \verb+A+ field is specified to be an unsigned int of width 8 bits,
the \verb+B+ field is a record, the first element of which is a
character array of size 13, and then second element of which is a 32
bit integer; finally the last field is specified to be a
boolean.

\item Variable-sized strings. The \verb+len+ field determines the
  length of the \verb+elts+ field.

\begin{verbatim}
  { len : u16
    elts : char [len]
  }
\end{verbatim}


\item The following is shows how the \konst{Union} construct might be
  used for multiple versions.  Versions less than 14 have 3 fields in
  the message, while all others have 2.

\begin{verbatim}
  {versionID : u8
   versions : Union {
      (versionID < 14, { A : i32, B : u16})
      (versionID >= 14, { Vec : char [13]})
    }
  }
\end{verbatim}

\item The following is a contrived example showing the need for
  resolution of multiple similarly named fields; it also shows how the
  information needed to determine the message structure may be deeply
  buried in some fields.

\begin{verbatim}
  {len : u16
   A : {len : u16
        elts : u16[len]
       }
   B : char [A.len * len]
   C : i32 [A.elts[0]]
  }
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expressions}

In programming languages, an \emph{L-value} is an expression that can
occur on the left-hand side of an assignment statement. Similarly,
\emph{R-value} designates expressions occurring on the right-hand side
of assignments. A few examples:

\begin{verbatim}
    x := x + 1
    A[x] := B.y + 42
    A[x].lens.fst[7] := MAX_LEN * 1024 + B.y
\end{verbatim}

An L-value denotes an \emph{offset} from the beginning of a
data structure, plus a \emph{width}. In an R-value, an occurrence of an
L-value is mapped to the value of the patch of memory between
$\mathit{offset}$ and $\mathit{offset} + \mathit{width}$. For the
purpose of specifying message formats, it may not be immediately
obvious that a notation supporting assignment in imperative languages
can help, but there is indeed a form of assignment lurking.

An L-value can be a variable, an array index, or a record field
access. R-values are arithmetic expressions that can contain L-values
(we will use $\mathit{exp}$ interchangeably with R-value). Thus the
definitions of $\mathit{lval}$, $\mathit{exp}$ and $\mathit{bexp}$ are

\begin{figure}
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mathit{lval} & = & \mathit{varname} \mid
                    \mathit{lval} \, [ \mathit{exp} ] \mid
                    \mathit{lval} . \mathit{fieldname} \\
  & & \\
\mathit{exp} & = & \konst{Loc}\; \mathit{lval}
              \mid \konst{nLit}\; \konst{nat}
              \mid \mathit{constname}
              \mid \mathit{exp} + \mathit{exp}
              \mid \mathit{exp} * \mathit{exp} \\
  & & \\
\mathit{bexp} & = & \konst{bLit}\; bool
              \mid  \neg \mathit{bexp}
              \mid  \mathit{bexp} \lor \mathit{bexp}
              \mid  \mathit{bexp} \land \mathit{bexp}
              \mid  \mathit{exp} = \mathit{exp}
              \mid  \mathit{exp} < \mathit{exp}
\end{array}
\]
\caption{L-values, expressions, and boolean expressions}
\end{figure}

Given environments $\theta: \mathit{lval} \to \konst{string}$, binding
lvals to strings, $\Delta : \konst{string} \to \mathbb{N}$, binding
constant names to numbers, and function
$\konst{toN}:\konst{string}\to\mathbb{N}$, which interprets ASCII
characters strings as binary-encoded numbers, expression evaluation
and boolean expression evaluation proceed conventionally:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\konst{evalExp} \; e =
\mathtt{case}\; e\
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{lcl}
    \konst{Loc}\; \lval & \Rightarrow & \konst{toN}(\theta(\lval)) \\
    \konst{nLit}\; n & \Rightarrow & n  \\
    \mathit{constname} & \Rightarrow & \Delta(\mathit{constname})  \\
    e_1 + e_2 & \Rightarrow & \konst{evalExp}\; e_1 + \konst{evalExp}\; e_2  \\
    e_1 * e_2 & \Rightarrow & \konst{evalExp}\; e_1 * \konst{evalExp}\; e_2  \\
  \end{array}
 \right.
 \\ \\
\konst{evalBexp} \; b =
\mathtt{case}\; b\
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{lcl}
    \konst{bLit}\; b_1 & \Rightarrow & b_1 \\
    \neg b_1 & \Rightarrow & \neg(\konst{evalBexp} \; b_1)  \\
    b_1 \lor b_2 & \Rightarrow & \konst{evalBexp} \;b_1 \lor \konst{evalBexp} \;b_2   \\
    b_1 \land b_2 & \Rightarrow & \konst{evalBexp} \;b_1 \land \konst{evalBexp} \;b_2   \\
    e_1 = e_2 & \Rightarrow & \konst{evalExp} \;e_1 = \konst{evalExp} \;e_2   \\
    e_1 < e_2 & \Rightarrow & \konst{evalExp} \;e_1 < \konst{evalExp} \;e_2
  \end{array}
 \right.

\end{array}
\]

\noindent\textbf{Remark}.

In spite of the structural similarity, a contiguity type is not a
type: it is a formal language. A type is usually understood to
represent a set (or domain) of values, \eg, the type \konst{int32}
represents a set of integers. In contrast, the contiguity type
\konst{i32} represents the set of strings of width 32 bits. An element
of a contiguity type can be turned into an element of a type by
providing interpretations for all the strings at the leaves and
interpreting the \konst{Recd} and \konst{Array} constructors into the
corresponding type constructs. Thus, contiguity types
sit---conveniently---between the types in a programming language and
the strings used to make messages.


\subsection{Semantics}

As mentioned, a contiguity type expresses a formal language. The
semantics definition depends on a few basic notions familiar from
language theory: language concatenation, and iterated language
concatenation.

\begin{align}
L_1 \cdot L_2 &= \set{w_1 w_2 \mid w_1 \in L_1 \land w_2 \in  L_2} \\
L^0 &= \varepsilon \\
L^{n+1} &= L \cdot L^n
\end{align}


\begin{definition}[Semantics of contiguity types]

 In the following, we assume given a assignment $\theta$ adequate for
evaluating expressions, \ie, having bindings for every
$\mathit{lval}$ in every $\mathit{exp}$ and $\mathit{bexp}$
occurring in $\tau$.

\[
% \begin{array}{l}
\Lang{\tau} =
\mathtt{case}\; \tau\
% \hspace*{3mm}
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{l}
 \mathit{base} \Rightarrow \set{s \mid \konst{len}(s) = \konst{width}(base)} \\
 \konst{Recd}\; (f_1 : \tau_1) \ldots (f_n : \tau_n)
      \Rightarrow \Lang{\tau_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot \Lang{\tau_n}
\\
 \konst{Array}\; \tau_1 \; \mathit{exp}
      \Rightarrow  \Lang{\tau_1}^{\konst{evalExp}\;\theta\;\mathit{exp}}
\\
 \konst{Union}\; (\mathit{bexp}_1 : \tau_1) \ldots (\mathit{bexp}_n : \tau_n) \Rightarrow \\
  \hspace*{5mm}
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{ll}
    \Lang{\tau_i} &  \mathrm{if}\ \konst{evalBexp}\;\theta\;\mathit{bexp}_i = \konst{true} \\
                  & \mathrm{and\ no\ other}\ \mathit{bexp}_j\ \mathrm{evaluates\ to}\ \konst{true}  \\
    \emptyset & \mathrm{otherwise}
 \end{array}
 \right.
 \\
\end{array}
 \right.
%\end{array}
\]
\end{definition}

\section{Algorithms}

We are working on the following algorithms over contiguity types.

\begin{itemize}

\item Parsing (decoding). Break a sequence of bytes up and put the
  pieces into a parse tree, or some useful data structure.

\item Filtering (does a sequence of bytes meet the specification of a
  contiguity type). This is an instance of the language recognition
  problem: given a formal specification of a language, decide if a
  string is in the language. More powerful filters enforce that certain
  fields of a message, when interpreted, meet specific semantic
  properties.

\item Serialization (encoding). Given a data structure, write a compact
  binary version to a message.

\item Fuzzing (test generation). Given a contiguity type, generate
  byte sequences that do (or do not) meet its specification and feed
  the sequences to implementations in order to observe their behaviour.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parsing, decoding, and matching}

Let us recall the distinction between \emph{parsing}, which discovers
structure (parse trees), and \emph{matching}, which is given structure
and calculates assignments (substitutions).\footnote{Thus the notion
  of matching discussed here is in the tradition of term rewriting
  \cite{nipkow-trs-book}, the main difference being that our
  substitutions are applied to $\mathit{lvar}$s rather than
  variables.} Giving some types makes the difference clear:

\begin{align}
  \konst{parse} &: \mathit{grammar} \to \konst{string} \to \mathit{parse tree} \\
  \konst{match} &: \mathit{AST} \to \konst{string} \to \mathit{assignments}
\end{align}

The central algorithm for continuity types is a matcher: given a
contiguity type $\tau$ and a string $s$, the matcher will either fail,
or succeed with an assignment $\theta : \mathit{lval} \mapsto
\konst{string}$ mapping each L-value in $\tau$ to its corresponding
slice of $s$.

\begin{definition}[Matching algorithm]

The matching algorithm operates over a triple $(\mathit{worklist},
\mathit{string}, \theta)$ where $\mathit{worklist}$ is a stack used to
linearize the input contiguity type $\tau$, $\mathit{string}$
represents the remainder of the input string, and $\theta$ is the
assignment being built up.

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\konst{matchFn}\; (\mathit{worklist}, \mathit{string}, \theta) = \\
\end{array}
\]

\end{definition}

The correctness statement for the matcher is similar to that found for
matching in term rewriting.

\begin{theorem}[Matcher correctness]

\[
  \forall \tau\;s.\; \konst{match}\; \tau \; s = (\theta, s') \imp \theta(\tau) \cdot s' = s
\]

\noindent\textit{Proof}. In progress

\end{theorem}

A matcher with this property will break up the input string in
accordance with the specification; it also generates a sequence of
assignments that, when executed, will populate a data structure with
the specified data in the specified places. Therefore it is not really
necessary to generate parse trees to decode: one merely needs a data
structure to write data into. The correctness property will ensure
that \emph{all} fields are written, and with the specified data. The
assignments can be incrementally evaluated as the decoder runs, or can
be stored and applied when the decoder terminates.\footnote{Beware: in
  the incremental approach, if the decoder fails at some point, the
  result will be a partly filled data structure.}

\begin{example}
\end{example}


\section{Filtering}

The building blocks for expressing simple filters are already in
place. The skeleton of the matcher provides the needed traversal of
the string and the accumulation of contextual information in the form
of the map $\theta$. The $\mathit{bexp}$ provides an (impoverished but
adequately illustrative) assertion language over R-values. One
particularly simple approach we are investigating is to add a new
``assertion'' constructor to the definition of $\tau$:

\[
  \konst{Assert}(\mathit{bexp})
\]

\noindent For example, the following c-type (taking liberties with notation)

\begin{verbatim}
    { A : i32
      B : Assert (-90 <= toInt(A) <= 90)
    }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent supplies field \verb+B+, which is processed after field
\verb+A+, and scrutinizes the value of field \verb+A+ at
match time. When it comes to code-generation \verb+Assertion+ fields
are ignored, or can be added as assertion checks in the generated code.

Assertion fields can be immediately useful in checking basic
structural well-formedness properties, as well as user-specified
well-formedness. For example, c-types support enumerations. An
\emph{enumeration} declaration introduces a new base contiguity type,
and also adds the specified elements to the map associating constant
names to numbers. It can (and usually will) happen that the space
allowed to represent enumerations will be able to represent all the
elements in the enumeration, and more. Thus, an enumeration field can
hold a byte pattern that does not correspond to any element in the
enumeration, leading to malformed messages.

\begin{example}
 For example, suppose that enumerations are allowed to have up to 256
 elements, allowing any enumerated element to fit in one byte. The following
 enumeration (taken from the uxAS project \cite{}) is declared:
\begin{verbatim}
  NavigationMode
    = Waypoint | Loiter | FlightDirector
    | TargetTrack | FollowLeader | LostComm
\end{verbatim}

A field expecting a \verb+NavigationMode+ element will be 1 byte wide,
and thus there are 250 byte patterns that should not be allowed in the field. Thus, the c-type

\begin{verbatim}
  { A : NavigationMode }
\end{verbatim}

should be replaced by

\begin{verbatim}
  { A : NavigationMode
    A-range : Assert (A <= 5)
  }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent in order to specify an on-the-fly check.

\end{example}

Another example from uxAS, in which the length of every array element
is held in a length field 2 bytes in length. Thus the following
c-type, in the absence of any constraint, supports arrays of length up
to 65535 elements, which the receiver system may well not be prepared
to accept.

\begin{verbatim}
  { len : u16
    elts : i32 [len] }
\end{verbatim}

This problem is remedied by the following enhanced c-type:

\begin{verbatim}
  { len : u16
    len-range : Assert (len <= 8)
    elts : i32 [len] }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Note that the expected array length should be specified
before the array itself, otherwise the allocation atttempt will be
made before the check.

\begin{itemize}

\item The assertion language will have to be beefed up in order to be
  useful, and should also be extensible as well. In the context of
  CASE, the AADL/AGREE/SPLAT toolchain does provide this, for a
  limited class of types.

\item Assertions on arrays (how best to specify universal and
  existential predicates on arrays.)

\item Choice as to whether processing should fail as soon as one
  assertion fails vs. going all the way through and keeping track of
  all the failures for a final report.

\end{itemize}

\section{Extensions and future work}

Implemented extensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Enums
\item Raw chunks
\item Guest scanners
\item Non-copying versions; changes to semantics; there is possibility
  of quite fast implementations when no L-values referenced anywhere
  in contig type.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The following are current and future work.

\begin{itemize}
\item bitfields (pure) and mixtures of bits/bytes
\item Add Kleene Star: repeatedly get elements until failure.
\item Currently, we are left-centric: only fields to the left of us in
  the input can determine what happens next. However, certain formats
  (\eg, IPv4) refer ahead.

\item Consider the following schema for an \emph{optional} contiguity type:

\begin{verbatim}
  Union { (bexp, {})
          (not(bexp), c)
   }
\end{verbatim}

In case $\mathit{bexp}$ evaluates to \konst{true}, no portion of the
string is consumed; otherwise, $c$ is processed. Having zero-size
contiguity types causes problems with arrays. For example

\begin{verbatim}
  {A: Union { (bexp, {}),
             (not(bexp), c) }
   B : A [3]
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}


\appendix

\section{Examples}

Following are some longer examples of contiguity types.

\begin{enumerate}

\item 802-11 MAC header. The format depends on an enumerated type

\begin{verbatim}
 Enum Frame = [("Management",0),
               ("Control",   1),
               ("Data",      2),
               ("Reserved",  3)
              ]
\end{verbatim}
\noindent The actual MAC header is in terms of bits while our current implementation
is for bytes. (Requires very little to change.) Also, we use the $\konst{Raw}(n)$
construct to break off a chunk of size $n$.
\begin{verbatim}
   {protocol  : Raw(2)
    type      : Frame
    subType   : Raw(4)
    toDS      : Raw(1)
    fromDS    : Raw(1)
    moreFrag  : Raw(1)
    retry     : Raw(1)
    powerMgmt : Raw(1)
    moreData  : Raw(1)
    wep       : Raw(1)
    order     : Raw(1)
    duration  : Raw(16)
    tails     : Union {
     (type = Frame'Data)
          --> {address1   : Raw(48)
               address2   : Raw(48)

               address4   : Raw(48)
              }
     (type = Frame'Control and subType = 11)
          --> {receiver    : Raw(48)
               transmitter : Raw(48)
              }
     (type = Frame'Control and subType = 12)
          --> {receiver : Raw(48)
              }
     }
    }
